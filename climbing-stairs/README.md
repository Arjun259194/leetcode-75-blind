# Climbing stairs

The problem states that there are `n` numbers of stairs. you have to climb the stairs with the condition of you can either climb one step or two step at a time. For example, if there are two steps (n = 2) there are two possible ways to climb if. 

1. 1 step, 1 step
1. 2 step

Now, you have to calculate all the possible ways to climb the stairs.

## solution road map

the first solution came across is recursion with the formula `f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)`.
